# FoscamFinder

This is a C# Application that allows you to find Foscam Cameras on your network and (hopefully) also interact with them.
It is meant to be used as a library and not as a fully finished application.

I started this because I found the Foscam API to be confusing/lacking in some cases, so I hope that this helps other people.
